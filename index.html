<section class="site-summary">

  <div class="card">
    <p>I am a Master's student in Human Language Technology with a background in linguistics and professional experience as a data analyst. I'm passionate about building language technology that makes a tangible difference—improving how people interact with the world and the internet through better language access and inclusivity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in French Language and Literature and a second Bachelor's in Applied Linguistics, which has deepened my understanding of language structure, acquisition, and variation. My strengths lie in the socio-political dimensions of linguistics, with a focus on discourse analysis and a strong interest in the ethical uses of language technology (Machine Learning, LLMs, etc.).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>I specialize in data analysis, visualization, and natural language processing using tools like Python, R, SQL, and libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, and scikit-learn. I’m also proficient in French, having studied the language for over 13 years.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>I am currently completing an <a href="https://rofljen.github.io/HLTProfessionalSite/portfolio/portfolio-1/">internship with XRI Global</a> with the aim of increasing access to language models for low-resource languages. I’m especially interested in projects that intersect language, equity, and technology—whether that’s building fairer NLP systems, visualizing bias in data, or supporting multilingual access to services.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>I love collaborative problem-solving and approach my work with a mix of creativity and precision. After my Master's, I hope to work in a role where I can continue bridging data science and linguistics in meaningful ways—whether in industry, research, or the nonprofit space, in roles that draw on my strong background in data analysis. If you're working on something exciting in this space, I'd love to connect.</p>
