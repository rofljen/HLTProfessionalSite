<p><strong>Project Context:</strong> This project was developed as part of my work in <em>LING 581: Computational Text Analysis</em>, in the M.S. in Human Language Technology program. It explored how stylometric techniques—quantitative measures of linguistic style—can be used to attribute authorship of nonfiction writing samples.</p>

<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> The primary goal was to evaluate whether textual metrics such as average word length, lexical diversity, and part-of-speech frequency could distinguish between authors like David Foster Wallace, Joan Didion, and Zadie Smith. I applied a range of NLP tools (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) to analyze manually chunked essay data. I used Python to clean, tokenize, and process the text, extract linguistic features, and visualize author-specific patterns.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python (NLTK, spaCy, Matplotlib, seaborn)</li>
  <li>Pandas & NumPy for data wrangling</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualizations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcomes and Skills Applied</h2>
<p>By leveraging skills developed across HLT courses like LING 508 and 578, I was able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design and implement a custom text preprocessing pipeline</li>
  <li>Apply stylometric principles to classify text authorship</li>
  <li>Generate meaningful insights using data visualizations and statistical summaries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stylometric markers like word and sentence length, POS tag frequency, and lexical diversity provide useful signals for distinguishing between authors.</li>
  <li>Even basic text metrics can reveal stylistic fingerprints, especially when normalized
